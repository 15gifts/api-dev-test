I didnt want to overstep the time limit but ill write down the steps i was going to take to implement the final function.

1. i was going to add a button "add to list " on the containers that would push the name and type of beer to a list using  a if statement i would check if the type of beer has a  count equal or greater than the limit (this would'nt take any great  computing power as the list would fit a max of 60 beers)

2. i was then going to use react resuable components to loop through the list and display it on a sidebar
