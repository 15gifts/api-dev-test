# Story
The quarterly review of the company is upon us and we need to decide on cocktails for everyone! There's 50 people expected to go and we want a good variety of cocktails ahead of time to organise ingredients to buy. 

# The test
Using the Cocktail DB api (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) create a single page application where people can search cocktails by name, ingredients or popular cocktails and display all the cocktails with their names, images and description. The single page application should allow the user to add a cocktail they like to a general basket where all the employees of the company can see/add to. There will be a limit of 10 different types of cocktails and a total limit of 100 cocktails overall in the basket. You have a 2 hour limit to do this test. We don't expect you to finish (although if you do then thats good too) we just want to test your way of thinking and how you go about solving this problem.

# The tools
You can use any tools you are comfortable with to code this application (ReactJS, Vue, Angular...) and you must use the Cocktail DB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) to get the data from. You are welcome to add any documentation to your code especially commands for us to test it.
