# api-dev-test
This test is aimed at Front End developer candidates. Ideally, we'd like you to try and use Javascript (Typescript if you can) and React as this closely matches what you'd be using while working with us. If you are more comfortable in Vue or some other framework or language, then please use that. If you are applying for one of our other roles and sent this test, please use which ever scripting language you feel best shows of your abilities. If you can use the format we mention above, then that's great!

# Getting started
When you start the test, create a branch off of master that you will name after yourself. When you are done, create a pull request and assign it to Clara Grant or Dean Pugh. If you can't create a Pull Request, then don't worry please add your project in a zip folder and send it to us via email. Good luck!

# Story
The quarterly review of the company is upon us and we need to decide on cocktails for everyone! There's 50 people expected to go and we want a good variety of cocktails ahead of time to organise ingredients to buy. 

# The test
Using the Cocktail DB api (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) create a solution where people can search cocktails by name, ingredients or by either alcoholic or category and display all the cocktails with their names, images and instructions.

Ideally, this would be a single page application, and should allow the user to add a cocktail they like to a general basket where all the employees of the company can see/add to. There will be a limit of 10 different types of cocktails and a total limit of 100 cocktails overall in the basket.

You have a 2 hour limit to do this test. We don't expect you to finish (although if you do then thats good too) we just want to test your way of thinking and how you go about solving this problem.

# Final bit
As mentioned above, you can use any tools you are comfortable with to code this application (ReactJS, Vue, Angular...), but you must use the Cocktail DB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) to get the data from. You are welcome to add any documentation to your code especially commands for us to test it.
